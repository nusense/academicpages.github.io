This list of projects is part of a "challenge" amongst members at the [Fox.Build makerspace](https://fox.build).  The idea it to commit to doing 15 projects in the year 2019.   By making the list public list we're making each other more accountable (see Rick's reference to: [commitment device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_device))

My 0-th item _thus_ is this list itself.
